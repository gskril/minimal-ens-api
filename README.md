# Minimal ENS API

Simple Cloudflare Worker that resolves an ENS name to an ETH address for the purpose of monitoring gateway uptime.

It's recommended to set the `ETH_RPC_URL` environment variable in Cloudflare for consistent results.

See [gskril/ens-api](https://github.com/gskril/ens-api) for a fully-featured ENS API.
